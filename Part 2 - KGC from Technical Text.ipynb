    "Maintenance work orders (MWOs) capture information on the maintenance performed on assets. Much of this information is structured - such as dates, the functional location (the specific identifier of the asset), costs, and so on. However, a significant volume of the knowledge buried within a MWO is unstructured and therefore inaccessible - it is buried within the short text description.\n",

It would be useful to be able to automatically discover these, however it is next to impossible to manually trawl through thousands of these work orders to discover patterns. We need some way to ask questions of our unstructured data, which is where knowledge graphs shine.\n",

    "### 2.2.5. Sequence Labelling and Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two umbrella terms that almost all NLP tasks fall under - **sequence labelling** and **text classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Sequence labelling** involves assigning a label to every item in a sequence. Examples of sequence labelling tasks involve Named Entity Recognition (assigning an entity class label to every token in a sentence) and Lexical Normalisation (assigning the correct form of the word to every word in a sentence).\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Text classification** involves assigning one or more label(s) to an entire sequence. Examples of text classification tasks include sentiment analysis (determining whether a document is positive, negative, or neutral). In this notebook, our Relation Extraction model is also a text classification model (determine the relation type of a given (entity 1, entity 2, context)).\n",
    "\n",
    "![NLP Tasks](images/nlp_tasks.jpg \"NLP Tasks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, there are three widely-used types of methods for sequence labelling and text classification: **rule-based methods**, **feature extraction-based methods**, and **representation learning** methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rule-based methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule-based methods for sequence labelling/text classification are relatively straightfoward: we define rules that govern how a particular token or sequence should be labelled. These rules can simple, i.e. in the form of \"token\" &rarr; \"label\", such as \"pump\" &rarr; \"Item\", or more complex using regular expressions (\"p\" followed by any number of \"u\" characters followed by \"mp\" &rarr; \"Item\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule-based methods take significant manual effort to develop and refine. They are effectively hard-coded to one dataset - rules defined on one dataset do not necessarily work on another dataset. They are also prone to user error, particularly when one token can have multiple meanings depending on context (such as \"pump\" being either an \"Item\" or \"Activity\").\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature extraction-based sequence labelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike rule-based systems, which are more prevalent in commercial applications, feature extraction (i.e. machine-learning) based methods do not require users to spend copius amounts of time developing rule sets for one specific application. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feature-based models are trained on *handcrafted features*, which are carefully selected by the developer to incorporate their own domain knowledge to the particular task. For example, in NER, a commonly-used feature is whether a word begins with a capital letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction-based models include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hidden markov models (HMM)**: A finite-state automata with probabilistic transitions between states.\n",
    "- **Conditional random fields (CRF)**: Undirected graphical models that aim to predict multiple variables dependent on one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Representation learning-based sequence labelling\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent research in NER trends towards deep learning-based models such as Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and Transformers. These models require very little manual effort to employ - they simply need a set of annotated training data. The words are fed through an embedding layer to obtain word embedding vectors, which then propagate through the model. Deep learning models excel when trained on large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several representation learning-based models commonly used throughout NLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feedforward neural networks**: A \"simple\" neural network comprised of multiple layers.\n",
    "- **Recurrent neural networks (RNN)**: A type of neural network designed to handle sequential data.\n",
    "- **Long short-term memory models (LSTMs)**: A type of RNN that fares better on long sequences (avoids the \"vanishing gradient problem).\n",
    "- **Gated recurrent units (GRUs)**: Similar to LSTM, but with fewer gates (thus, simpler).\n",
    "- **Convolutional neural networks**: A neural network that begins with a convolutional layer.\n",
    "- **Transformers**: An encoder/decoder model that combines feedfoward neural networks with multi-headed attention mechanisms.\n",

    "There are two main reasons why applying lexical normalisation to erroneous/noisy texts is advantageous: **improved downstream performance** in NLP tasks (van der Goot *et al.*, 2017) and **improved quality in knowledge representation** (e.g. nodes in a knowledge graph).\n",

    "The task of lexical normalisation was introduced by (Han and Baldwin, 2011) and made popular through the 2015 workshop on noisy user-generated text (WNUT) (Baldwin *et al.*, 2015) where the main focus was on social media posts, namely Twitter as they capture significant lexical noise. Since then there has been significant progress in the task, with state-of-the-art performance achieved via pipelines of ensembles of discriminators (neural, embeddings) (van der Goot *et al.*, 2017), however statistical/neural token-classification (Stewart *et al.*, 2018; Muller *et al.*, 2019) and sequence-to-sequence (Lourentzou *et al.*, 2019; Nguyen and Sandro, 2020) models have also demonstrated promising performance in various contexts. Recently, state-of-the-art performance on multilingual lexical normalisation has been achieved by fine-tuning ByT5 transformer (Samuel and Milan, 2021; van der Goot *et al.*, 2021).\n",

    "## 6.1. Overview of Relation Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relation extraction** is the process of determining the relationships between entities in text. It plays a pivotal role in knowledge graph construction as it provides the relation component of each triple.\n",
    " \n",
    "For our application we are going to use of the following relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **HAS_OBSERVATION**: A relationship between an `Item` and an `Observation`.\n",
    " - **HAS_ACTIVITY**: A relationship between an `Item` and an `Activity`.\n",
    " - **APPEARS_WITH**: A relationship between an `Item` and another `Item`.\n",
    " \n",
    "Note that this is just one way to represent relationships in the data. It is an example of **co-occurrence relations**, i.e. the relationships are formed between entities that co-occur in the same document. We are modelling them this way in light of the types of queries we want to be able to write (e.g. \"what are all failure modes observed on pumps\"), but the code here will be applicable to any relation types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.1. Historical approaches to RE\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous approaches to Relation Extraction treated the task as a **text classification** task, i.e. given two entities, determine the relationship between them. This can be seen in, for example, the [SemEval 2010 Task 8](https://aclanthology.org/S10-1006/). Many of these methods were **feature extraction-based**, making use of a range of different features such as the local context, the part of speech (noun, verb, etc), syntactic patterns, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.2. State-of-the-art\n",
    "\n",
    "The current SOTA relation extraction models are predominately deep learning based. Many of the most recent RE models perform both NER and RE simultaneously, and thus \"relation extraction\" is becoming less popular as a task on its own. The models perform both NER + RE by taking a sentence as input and producing a sequence that looks like a marked-up list of triples (such as `<triplet>UWA<subj>Michael<obj>works at`). Examples of these models include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [**DeepStruct: Pretraining of Language Models for Structure Prediction**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10475): A sequence-labelling based method that uses structure pretraining.\n",
    " - [**REBEL: Relation extraction by end-to-end language generation.**](https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.204/): An autoregressive sequence to sequence model.\n",
    " - [**Span-based joint entity and relation extraction with transformer pre-training (SpERT)**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07755): A joint NER + Relation extraction model based on the BERT language model.\n",
    " - [**GenIE: generative information extraction**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.08340): A generative model that makes use of an existing knowledge base to constrain the types of relations produced based on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a list of RE models feel free to check out [Awesome Relation Extraction](https://github.com/roomylee/awesome-relation-extraction) or [NLP Progress](https://nlpprogress.com/english/relationship_extraction.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flair\n",
    "\n",
    "In the interest of simplicity and explainability, we will be performing RE separately from NER, rather than making use of these joint NER + RE models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are thus once again going to use Flair, this time to perform Relation Extraction. As of the time of writing this notebook, Flair does have support for RE, but not in the latest branch. We will thus be using Flair's Text Classification model to devise our own method for running relation extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Relation Extraction task will be as follows: *given a row of (entity_1, entity_2, label_1, label_2, context), determine the type of relationship*. All components of the row are concatenated into a single sequence which is then fed through the model to produce the predicted label.\n",

    "# 10. What next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to use/adapt any of this code to build your own knowledge graphs. You might like to try running it on your own datasets, or designing your own `NERModel` or `REModel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some potential areas to explore after this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.1. Improving the lexical normalisation model\n",
    "\n",
    "We only briefly touched on the lexical normalisation component of Knowledge Graph Construction from Text. There are plenty of neural models for lexical normalisation available that yield much better performance than our lexicon-based tagger.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also developed a tool (Lexiclean) to support the rapid creation of training data for lexical normalisation - you can learn about it [here](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-demo.25/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.2. Incorporating other structured data into the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases are excellent at bringing together data from a wide range of sources. In a maintenance setting, there are two particular types of structured data that can be easily added to this knowledge graph schema: Downtime events, and Functional Locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downtime events\n",
    "\n",
    "A downtime event is a point in time in which an asset is not operational. These events typically have costs and dates associated with them, and can be associated with particular `Item` entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "By modelling both work orders and downtime events in one graph, we can make queries about downtime events. Here is an example query for the __downtime events associated with assets appearing in work orders from 25 to 28 July (where the downtime events occurred in July)__:\n",
    "\n",
    "    MATCH (d:Document)<-[a:APPEARS_IN]-(e:Entity)-[r:HAS_EVENT]->(x:DowntimeEvent)\n",
    "    WHERE d.StartDate > 20050725\n",
    "    AND d.StartDate < 20050728\n",
    "    AND 20050700 <= x.StartDate <= 20050731\n",
    "    RETURN e, r, x\n",
    "\n",
    "We can of course extend this to specific assets, such as pumps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    MATCH (d:Document)<-[a:APPEARS_IN]-(e:Entity {name: \"pump\"})-[r:HAS_EVENT]->(x:DowntimeEvent)\n",
    "    WHERE d.StartDate > 20050725\n",
    "    AND d.StartDate < 20050728\n",
    "    AND 20050700 <= x.StartDate <= 20050731\n",
    "    RETURN e, r, x\n",
    "\n",
    "In larger graphs the downtime events could even be further queried based on duration, cost, lost feed, or date ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Locations (FLOCs)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that our original `work_order_data.csv` has a column called \"FLOC\". This is the functional location of the asset being maintained. In the maintenance domain, this is often of greater interest to reliability engineers than the individual `Item` entities, and thus it would be ideal to create nodes to represent these functional locations in the graph. This way, we could run queries on the failure modes associated with particular FLOCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in continuing work on this small graph, the next best step would be to create nodes for the functional location data (`floc_data`) and to link the downtime events to those nodes as opposed to the Item nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](images/adding-flocs.png \"Adding FLOCs\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asset Hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating asset hierarchy taxonomies such as ISO15926 allows for assets to be queried hierchically, e.g. querying over all rotating equipment, etc. Failure modes can also be grouped into specific failure mode categories in order to improve failure mode queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.3. Consolidating the training data for NER+RE\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that our training data is split into two parts for the NER and RE tasks, i.e. the NER is in CONLL format and the RE is in tabular format. It is possible to put both the NER and RE training data into a single file, using the mention format we showed previously. For example, each row of your training data could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    { tokens: [<list of tokens>], mentions: [<list of mentions>], relations: [<list of relations>] }\n",
    "    \n",
    "... and you could have a script to 'wrangle' this into the CONLL and tabular format before feeding them into the NER and RE model respectively. If you use a tool like [QuickGraph](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-demo.27/) your data will be in a similar format to the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.4. Coreference resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if we ask our model to tag the following?\n",
    "\n",
    "    pump is broken . it needs fixing\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"it\" will most likely not be tagged as an `Item` as it is not an item at all, but a preposition. Our knowledge graph will not capture the relationship between `pump` and `fixing` because of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coreference resolution is the process of automatically determining the coreferences of words in the text. In the example above, the word \"it\" is a coference for \"pump\", and thus running coreference resolution on this document would yield:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pump is broken . pump needs fixing\n",
    "    \n",
    "There is not much to gain from doing this on these short text records (as prepositions are few and far between), but on longer text records (such as maintenance long text, safety reports, etc), coreference resolution is a critical step in the information extraction task.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are neural models available to do coference resolution, such as `neuralcoref` in the `spaCy` package (see [here](https://spacy.io/universe/project/neuralcoref)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.5. From Pipeline to End-to-End Knowledge Graph Construction from Text\n",
    "\n",
    "We have presented a \"pipeline\" for KGC here in this notebook. We wrote the notebook this way in order to be able to discuss each of the components (Lexical Normalisation, Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction) in isolation, thus making them easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the current state of the art in NLP/TLP is moving away from pipeline-based KGC models and towards end-to-end neural models, i.e. a single neural model that performs all of these steps simultaneously. If you are interested in learning about this, you might like to read some of the following papers:\n",
